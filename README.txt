Scripts for Computing Roll Resonance

Input data is based on the Mid-Altitude Demonstrator rocket, in the form of 
aerodynamic data. Output data from 6-DOF program ASTOS is also used for comparison.

- For Python, navigate to Python folder.
  -> For script compilation, ensure that scipy and numpy packages are installed.
  -> Within the Python3 environment, run the CalcRollResonance.py script using the command "python3 CalcRollResonance.py".

- For MATLAB, navigate to the MATLAB folder and run the CalcRollResonance.m script.

Note: Both MATLAB and Python code are programmed similarly using an object-oriented style of programming, therefore the code should look very similar. Some differences in numerical output remain (WIP).

Journal articles for tricyclic theory and computation of roll resonance for sounding rockets are included.
